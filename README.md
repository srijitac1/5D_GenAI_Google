# 5D_GenAI_Google
5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course was a live event from March 31st to April 4th 2025.

ðŸ“œ **Course Contents**
**â˜† Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering** - Explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Get trained with the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

**â˜† Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases** - Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoffs.

**â˜† Day 3: Generative AI Agents -** Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.

**â˜† Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs -** Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

**â˜† Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI -** Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications
